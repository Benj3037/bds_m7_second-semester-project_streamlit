# <span style="font-width:bold; font-size: 3rem; color:#2656a3;">**Msc. BDS - M7 Second Semester Project Streamlit** 
EXAM ASSIGNMENT - Repository for Streamlit belonging to the repository [bds_m7_second-semester-project](https://github.com/tobiasmj97/bds_m7_second-semester-project).

## Objectives:
This repository contains all Python files for the final Streamlit application belonging to the second-semester project on the Master in Business Data Science at Aalborg University Business School.

The objective is to make a functional frontend application that visually demonstrates the projectâ€™s application in real-world scenarios.
This project aims to build a prediction system that forecasts the electricity prices in Denmark (area DK1) based on weather conditions, previous prices, and the Danish calendar.

## Structure:
There are four files in this repository representing each page in the Streamlit app:
1. Price Prediction
2. Explore
3. Performance
4. About

### ðŸŒ¦Price Prediction
The main page showcases the electricity price predictor for area DK1 in an interactive linechart. The linechart visualizes the forecasted electricity prices for the coming days enabling the user to hover over the line to see the exact price at a specific time.
The user can change the date range from 1-5 in the sidebar.

### ðŸŒŽExplore
The Explore page enables a more in-depth exploration of the electricity price prediction. The user can change the desired date range from 1-5. The page enables the user to choose between several different visualizations:
- Matrix for forecasted electricity prices for the comming days. Each column represents a day and each row represents a time of day.

Several visualizations showcasing the actual electricity prices and the prices predicted by the model enable the models' performances to be translated from technical to non-technical audiences:
- An interactive linechart of the predicted electricity prices compared with the actual electricity prices.
- Box Plot of Electricity Prices visualizing the actual and predicted electricity prices.
- Histogram displaying the actual and predicted electricity prices.

### ðŸ“ŠPerformance
The Performance page visualizes the models' performance using validation metrics RMSE, MAE, MSE, and R^2 to demonstrate the performance for a technical audience.  

### ðŸ“šAbout
The About page dives into the Learning Objectives the project is demonstrating and the main objective the frontend application aims to fulfill. 

## Frontend Application on ðŸ¤— Hugging Face Spaces:
The final Streamlit app is hosted on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Camillahannesbo/Electricity_price).
