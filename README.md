EXAM ASSIGNMENT - Repository for Streamlit belonging to the repository [bds_m7_second-semester-project](https://github.com/tobiasmj97/bds_m7_second-semester-project).

## Objectives:
This repository contains all Python files for the final Streamlit application belonging to the second-semester project on the Master in Business Data Science at Aalborg University Business School.

The objective is to make a functional frontend application that visually demonstrates the projectâ€™s application in real-world scenarios.
This project aims to build a prediction system that forecasts the electricity prices in Denmark (area DK1) based on weather conditions, previous prices, and the Danish calendar.

## Structure:
1. Price Prediction
2. Explore
3. Performance
4. About

### ðŸŒ¦Price Prediction
The main page showcases the electricity price predictor for area DK1 in an interactive linechart. The linechart visualise the forecasted electricity prices for the coming days enabling the user to hover over the line to see the exact price at a specific time.
The user can change the date range in the sidebar.

### ðŸŒŽExplore

Actual and predicted prices are displayed for translating the models' performances from technical to non-technical audiences.

### ðŸ“ŠPerformance
The Performance page visualizes the models' performance using validation metrics RMSE, MAE, MSE, and R^2 to demonstrate the performance for a technical audience.  

### ðŸ“šAbout
The About page dives into the Learning Objectives the project is demonstrating and the main objective the frontend application aims to fulfill. 



## Frontend Application on ðŸ¤— Hugging Face Spaces:
The final Streamlit app is hosted on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Camillahannesbo/Electricity_price).
